# CharacterCounter

This java program takes in a string (from a user or a file). Upon starting the program, it 
computes the total number of occurrences of each character in the ASCII set. It then prints 
out the top three characters (with the most occurrences). Then it prints out how many 
characters in the ASCII set that was not found in the ASCII set. Then print out the string 
in reverse order. Then it loops back to the menu to either start again or exit the program.
